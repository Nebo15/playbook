## Sale
We are Fintech RnD team
We do develop our own products
We provide wide expertize and IT services for customers in the Fintech Domain but not limited to.
We can provide RnD services as well. To do that there should be a match between our expertize and customer need. 
We target to develop team's skills in the cutting edge technologies like

## Pre-Sale

## Business Design
We do currently use
* Confluence
* Apiary
* GitHub
* ERD

It produces
* Architecture
* BRD - not always
* Business processes

## Technical Specifications
Before the technical specs will be developed there should be a design sprint where the requirements will be introduced to the entire team

Technical specifications might be produced by both: SA and Dev

We do currently use
* Confluence
* Apiary
